## Why you change UIVisualEffectView alpha?  

First, I changed UIVisualEffectView alpha. I got this error message and blurred image got glitch when scrolling.  
```
<UIVisualEffectView 0x7fd1d0440a20> is being asked to animate its opacity. This will cause the effect to appear broken until opacity returns to 1.
```

```
When using the UIVisualEffectView class, avoid alpha values that are less than 1. Creating views that are partially transparent causes the system to combine the view and all the associated subviews during an offscreen render pass. UIVisualEffectView objects need to be combined as part of the content they are layered on top of in order to look correct. Setting the alpha to less than 1 on the visual effect view or any of its superviews causes many effects to look incorrect or not show up at all.
```
